## Study of the communities inside the European Parliament before and after the Brexit vote
In this project we study with an engineering approach a network based on the
connection between MEPs of European Parliament.

We study in the same way a network before and a network after the day
when in United Kingdom people have been called to vote "remain" or "leave"
the European Union. The day was 23 June 2016 when 51.9 per cent of those who
voted supported withdrawal. Withdrawal has been advocated by Eurosceptics,
both left-wing and right-wing, while Pro-Europeanists (or European Unionists),
who also span the political spectrum, have advocated continued membership.
In this research we hope to nd about two/three dierent big groups, one of
the MPs pro-EU, one with MEPs against-EU and maybe a third "in between".
The key point is to understand how a big event like Brexit changes the
political system in the European Union.

The project was done for the Network Science Course (2019) at University of Padua by Denis Donadel and Martina Contisciani, with the supervisor of professor Tommaso Erseghe.

### How to
There is a Python notebook used for generate the matrix.
All the other computations have been done in with Matlab.
The results are presented inside Denis-Donadel-Network-Science-Essay.pdf.
